        <h1 id="I-Foreword"><a href="#I-Foreword" class="headerlink" title="I. Foreword"></a>I. Foreword</h1><p>In recent years, indie games seem to have taken a liking to Metroidvania, which has gained a cult following for its acquired abilities, mesh maps, and stylized unlockable areas. Metroid:Dread has returned as a predecessor to this craze, and seems to be breaking ranks with its successors. And much of what the internet has to say about this sequel to the granddaddy of Metroidvania games is that the gameplay is pure and smooth; the guidance is outstanding; and there’s a balance of linear and sequence-breaking flow. Metroid:Dread is certainly a stunning level structure in terms of its core gameplay of “acquire abilities - unlock areas”, but what surprised me even more was the fact that this generation’s theme of “fear” presented a slightly different version of Metroid. different version of Metroid. </p>
<p>So why did Metroid include horror?</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="II-Why-should-there-be-terror"><a href="#II-Why-should-there-be-terror" class="headerlink" title="II. Why should there be terror?"></a>II. Why should there be terror?</h1><p>It’s not hard to think that since there will be adventures, there is bound to be danger. As a game that focuses on map exploration, the unknown and uncertainty of the world is the main motivation for players to explore the map. The “unknown” not only arouses the player’s curiosity, but also brings a certain amount of fear at certain times. In other words, adventure and exploration go hand in hand with fear. In Dark Souls, the eerie atmosphere and powerful enemies often bring out fear (even more so than in Metroid:Dread). However, it is this situation where exploration is limited and the contrast of uncertainty brought about by danger and opportunity that can stir the player’s desire to explore to a greater extent and stir up their emotions while playing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Metroid series has always favored an atmosphere of solitude and exploration, which allows the horror elements to be seamlessly integrated into it. Continuing the experience of its predecessor, this generation’s horror atmosphere comes naturally.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="III-Essential-features-of-the-chase"><a href="#III-Essential-features-of-the-chase" class="headerlink" title="III. Essential features of the chase"></a>III. Essential features of the chase</h1><p>The chase itself implies tension and excitement, often appearing in the climax of the game, and is not a new thing in itself. In 2D platformer games like Ori and Celeste, which are built on platform jumping gameplay, chases don’t seem to have anything to do with “horror”, so what’s different about Metroid:Dread chases?</p>
<p><img src="/img/dread/05.png"></p>
<h2 id="Partial-whole"><a href="#Partial-whole" class="headerlink" title="Partial + whole"></a>Partial + whole</h2><p><strong>LOCAL</strong>: Metroid:Dread has been jokingly referred to as a “localized survival horror”, and it’s true. This is because it is only when you enter an E.M.M.I area that you will be pursued by monsters. Therefore, in terms of the distribution of areas in the game world, the fear is localized. -</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>: However, on a system level, the “fear” and battle-by-battle gameplay is consistent throughout. Not boss battles or special events, but inevitable aspects interspersed throughout the player’s play flow. Even when entering the E.M.M.I area, the player is still in the game flow of “exploring the map - looking for the exit”, and there is no separation from the other areas, but only the rhythm and atmosphere of the game.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dread/03.png"></p>
<p><strong><center>EMMI area diagonally across the entire map of Dairon</center></strong></p>
<h2 id="Unbeatable-enemies"><a href="#Unbeatable-enemies" class="headerlink" title="Unbeatable enemies"></a>Unbeatable enemies</h2><p>We’ve often said that to make a horror game, the protagonist has to be defenseless. Psychologically and practically, it’s easier to be terrorized when you can’t fight back.</p>
<p>E.M.M.I Chase, is a set of horror mechanics that combines dodging - and fighting back. In the avoidance phase, players can usually only run or sneak away from the road, and if they are touched, they will basically have to read the disk (while the return fire system with small probability + high operational precision is basically for the fast-passing players to prepare). It’s safe to say that once you enter the E.M.M.I area, Samus is defenseless - instant game over, which then becomes a major condition for the horror to emerge.</p>
<p>Additionally, the E.M.M.I area is devoid of regular glitches, which pulls the player’s attention away from combat and back to exploration and escape.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dread/00.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="AI-shortcuts"><a href="#AI-shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="AI shortcuts"></a>AI shortcuts</h2><p>E.M.M.I valves, i.e. valves that the player is not allowed to walk on but the E.M.M.I can act on. The appearance of this design greatly improves the flexibility of the monster AI to run the map and hunt down the player. There is only one E.M.M.I in an entire area, and it will reach the player’s location extremely quickly after receiving a signal, and enjoys path privileges during the pursuit process. This asymmetrical map design cracks the dilemma of simply controlling the AI’s speed, allowing the E.M.M.I to move more easily than the player, but not so much as to crush the player in terms of absolute speed, and testing the player’s path-planning and ad-hoc reactions more than anything else.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dread/01.png"></p>
<p><strong><center>The EMMI area of Catarius is littered with such monster-specific shortcuts</center></strong></p>
<h2 id="The-escape-return-cycle"><a href="#The-escape-return-cycle" class="headerlink" title="The escape-return cycle"></a>The escape-return cycle</h2><p>The fear of being chased will briefly subside when you get the big kill, but immediately the excitement will strike again - the conditions for using the big kill are quite demanding. We need to keep aiming and shooting down a long path, breaking through the shell and then building up the strength to fire a shot into the soul, and the whole process will be increasingly demanding.</p>
<p>At this point, because you have to stand still, the fear of a step by step attack will be more and more real, and the great power brought by the handheld killers will make the excitement reach its peak. The moment the player pulls the trigger, this whole area of “survival fear” will end with a bang, all the tension and pressure are also released. At this point, the fear of tension - planning a route to escape - to obtain the ability - to get the big killers - to face the fear The climax of the game - a shot into the soul formed a set of ups and downs to control the flow of the player’s mind.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dread/04.png"></p>
<h2 id="Perspective-Shift"><a href="#Perspective-Shift" class="headerlink" title="Perspective Shift"></a>Perspective Shift</h2><p>Although it’s a 2D perspective game, there are two moments other than the over-the-top CG where this perspective shifts: when you’re subdued on the ground, and when you get the kill weapon in your sights. These are at the climax of the process, and the player is unable to move, so it’s quite an interesting design to smoothly and comfortably switch the perspective to 3D, creating a localized and more realistic experience.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dread/02.png"></p>
<h2 id="Follow-the-growth"><a href="#Follow-the-growth" class="headerlink" title="Follow the growth"></a>Follow the growth</h2><p>The Metroid series doesn’t have as many RPG elements as the Castlevania-type games; its growth is more pure and intuitive, and it never skimped on giving the player a variety of uncanny abilities (infinite jumps with electricity, the Dance of the Phoenix to the end). After acquiring these abilities, there are more tricks to dodge and escape. E.M.M.I also grows with the player, not only in speed, but also in the skills they possess and the difficulty level of the maps, which allows the “fear” to grow progressively as the player grows faster.</p>
<p>Other things, such as the atmosphere of solitary exploration and eerie music, are all tools to enhance the sense of horror and excitement, so I won’t go into details here.</p>

<p>Level - Experience</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exploring the underlying mechanics of the chase is the first part of our analysis of the experience. These mechanics are modularly divided into several parts, and the rules and interrelationships must be established to further observe what combinations their levels bring to the mechanics. Some of these mechanisms are even directly related to the experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Localized Fear” is just one of the gameplay features of this generation of Metroid. It’s also essentially a thematic mechanic that was created by incorporating other gameplay systems, and there are many aspects of this that combine with the usual Metroid mechanics and gameplay.</p>
<h2 id="4-1-Basic-mechanisms"><a href="#4-1-Basic-mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="4.1 Basic mechanisms"></a>4.1 Basic mechanisms</h2><h3 id="Region-correlation"><a href="#Region-correlation" class="headerlink" title="Region correlation:"></a>Region correlation:</h3><ul>
<li>There exist 7 contiguous EMMI-containing regions that are connected to other regions</li>
<li>EMMI robots can only exist in EMMI zones, and there is only one in each zone.</li>
<li>EMMI zones appear gray on the map, and green after breaking an EMMI</li>
<li>EMMI zones have no minions other than scouts and EMMIs, and will spawn other minions when broken.</li>
<li>EMMI zones do not drop any archive points, but will automatically save when entering and exiting the zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monster related:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scout is the only small monster before breaking the area, flying on a fixed route, can only be killed with missiles (dropping a lot of missiles), will be revived indefinitely on the spot, but being touched will attract the attention of nearby EMMI.</p>
</li>
<li><p>EMMI has a fixed initial position and patrol route, the player into the line of sight will enter the state of pursuit (BGM tension), tracking the player and accelerated movement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the EMMI touches the player, unless the player presses Counter Attack at the moment of attack and triggers a low probability of successful judgment, he/she will die directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Countermeasures-Related"><a href="#Countermeasures-Related" class="headerlink" title="Countermeasures Related:"></a>Countermeasures Related:</h3><ul>
<li>Each EMMI area has a Shockwave room, which will contain a stationary low-level boss that is killed to gain the Shockwave needed to destroy the EMMI.</li>
<li>Normal use of the Shockwave is to go into hold L to enter a 3D view (can’t move), right stick to aim, and press Y to fire the laser.</li>
<li>To use the Shockwave, hold L to enter the 3D view, aim with the right stick, hold R to build up power, and press Y to fire.</li>
<li>Walking out of the Shockwave room requires using a Shockwave shot on the door.</li>
<li>EMMI requires hitting the shell and then the core. The shell needs to be fired continuously, and after the shell is briefly static and deformed, it will stand up and accelerate; the core needs to be taken away by a power-up shockwave.</li>
<li>After using the Shockwave to break the EMMI, it cannot be used until the next time it is acquired (one-time).</li>
<li>Defeating an EMMI grants access to the corresponding ability.</li>

<li>Other Progressive: To adapt to the progressive difficulty of the game and follow up the experience; EMMIs in each area differ in their allotment of speed and specific abilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-2-Mechanics-analysis"><a href="#4-2-Mechanics-analysis" class="headerlink" title="4.2 Mechanics analysis"></a>4.2 Mechanics analysis</h2><p><strong>Overall Area:</strong> The EMMI area is strongly associated with game progress and is a <strong>special area</strong> of the map. The player cannot stop or find an archive point in it, but can have the assurance of an automatic archive at the door. Empty areas in the atmosphere of loneliness and eeriness at the same time so that the player to focus on avoidance and escape, and give the **Chase ** in the player and EMMI more space to move, ** so that the level space in the ever-changing circumstances, the player can always experience the tension of constantly being chased, the thrill of the chase brought about by the unimpeded running, the rapid movement of the path of the uncertainty faced by the player and to make a random change of the sense of accomplishment, without worrying about the cost of death. A sense of accomplishment without the frustration of having to worry about the high cost of dying. **</p>
<p><strong>EMMI and Countermeasures:</strong> In the presence of scouts, even if the map is empty, the player sometimes needs to act cautiously, and the one-hit fatal nature of EMMI makes it extremely difficult to countermeasure, so the player needs to concentrate on dodging. Countermeasures need to operate three buttons at the same time and a long time to store power, not only highlights the power of the weapon,** but also adds to the length and complexity of the duel, standing still at the last moment to face the fear, amplifying the player’s emotions, defeating the previously invincible enemy, and transforming the tension into a sense of achievement. **</p>
<h3 id="Progressive-mechanics"><a href="#Progressive-mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Progressive mechanics"></a>Progressive mechanics</h3><blockquote>
<p>Progressive mechanics are crucial in Metroidvania games, and progressive elements, including lock-key structures, play a role in flow control, enabling the player to play on a pre-determined and stable line of experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The progressive mechanics mentioned here are primarily those things that are different each time you enter an EMMI area - the abilities held by the player, the ever-growing rate and capacity of EMMI, etc.</p>
<p><strong>At the zone level, the progressive mechanics are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Special terrain in EMMI zones - EMMI valves: narrow passages, only for EMMI to act in while tracking the player, inaccessible to the player; you can enter them as a shortcut with a sphere after breaking the EMMI in the zone; this is added to zones at a later stage.</li>
<li>Placement of new obstacles/terrain/mechanisms adapted to the player’s abilities - spider suction cups, sensor doors, hook-lock slots, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>** At the monster level, the progressive mechanics are as follows:**</p>
<ul>
<li>EMMI-01P: No armor.</li>
<li>EMMI-02SM: Armor added. (Spider magnets obtained upon kill)</li>
<li>EMMI-03MB: Can go EMMI valve. (Gain Morphing Sphere upon kill)</li>
<li>EMMI-04SB: Ability to move in a hurry. (Gain acceleration after killing) * EMMI-05IM: Ability to go EMMI valve.</li>
<li>EMMI-05IM: Ability to freeze players. (Gain Frozen Missile after kill)</li>
<li>EMMI-06WB: Ability is Paralyzing Electricity, in addition to having great vision and tracking abilities. (Gain Wave after kill)</li>
<li>EMMI-07PB: Ability to unleash a huge explosion. (Gain Power Bomb after kill)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the counter tier, the progressive mechanics are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For the first EMMI encounter, the player needs to store power from a distance to break the EMMI core.</li>
<li>For subsequent EMMI encounters, the player is required to break the shell at long range before storing up power to break the core.</li>
<li>For subsequent EMMI encounters, players need to first break the shell at long range, then run to long range to build up power to break the core.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key points: three progressive mechanisms are gradually increased ** map complexity, monster strength (avoidance difficulty), countermeasure difficulty **, to make such a structure on the one hand is able to make ** challenges follow the player’s growth occurs appropriate enhancement, to ensure that the experience of the heart of the flow **; on the other hand, after the breakthrough to obtain the ability of the monster design logic logical and reasonable, and in fact, and the monster’s own strength is also linked to, as a direct Feedback can largely satisfy the player.</p>
<h3 id="Emergent-Mechanics"><a href="#Emergent-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Emergent Mechanics"></a>Emergent Mechanics</h3><p>Progressive mechanics prescribe a flow that the designer presets for the player, which is full of stable experiences and facilitates narrative; emergent mechanics, on the other hand, focus on the relationships between elements, whose probability space is large and unstable, and which can lead to random, varied fun.</p>
<p>Here, emergent mechanics are primarily expressed in the distribution of the map and the player’s choice of paths - how many paths are available to the player when being chased by EMMI in an area? How many paths are safe? How many more paths are available when entering the next room? The combination of routes increases abruptly and it’s entirely up to the player to decide how to go. At this point, creating more path options, making sure each route is as viable as possible, and creating differences in the experience of each route becomes an area of attention in level design.</p>
<h2 id="4-3-Mechanics-Level-Play"><a href="#4-3-Mechanics-Level-Play" class="headerlink" title="4.3 Mechanics - Level Play"></a>4.3 Mechanics - Level Play</h2><blockquote>
<h1 id="What-kind-of-gameplay-is-derived-from-the-above-mechanisms"><a href="#What-kind-of-gameplay-is-derived-from-the-above-mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="What kind of gameplay is derived from the above mechanisms?"></a>What kind of gameplay is derived from the above mechanisms?</h1></blockquote>
<h2 id="Path-Planning"><a href="#Path-Planning" class="headerlink" title="Path Planning"></a>Path Planning</h2><p>When entering an E.M.M.I area for the first time, since the corresponding area of the mini-map has not yet been unlocked, the player can only improvise and rush forward to wherever it is. Fortunately, there is basically no absolute wrong way/dead end no matter where you go, and as long as you maneuver quickly, the player will always be able to find a way to escape. Even when blocked to a physically meaningful dead end, there are usually some mechanisms set up to help players kite, providing an opportunity to return the way they came. So while ensuring an exciting chase, it reduces player frustration and lowers the difficulty at a stage when they are still unfamiliar with the map.</p>
<p> And when acquiring the ability - returning to the E.M.M.I area, the framework of the whole area has been basically shown. This is when the player’s path-planning skills are more tested (often having to memorize door locations and kite points).</p>
<h2 id="Stealth"><a href="#Stealth" class="headerlink" title="Stealth"></a>Stealth</h2><p>During evasion, in addition to running to escape, it is also possible to sneak - using the Phantom Cloak to enter a short period of invisibility, although partially restricting the ability to move, the EMMI will not track the player, and touching still triggers a death ruling.</p>
<p>Additionally, hiding in a corner of the map with the cloaking + morphing orb will ensure that you will not be detected or touched, similar to hiding in a cabinet in a horror game.</p>
<p>! <a href="/img/dread/07.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="Flying-a-Kite"><a href="#Flying-a-Kite" class="headerlink" title="Flying a Kite"></a>Flying a Kite</h2><p>The player can lure and bypass EMMIs within the level and observe the mapping area at the same time. Kite flying is similar to the lure walks in asymmetric competitive games (Dawn of the Dead) that utilize terrain and movement mismatches. This is generally specified as slide shoveling (similar to window flipping) and utilizing hooklocks (where the player moves quickly).</p>
<h2 id="One-way-doors"><a href="#One-way-doors" class="headerlink" title="One-way doors"></a>One-way doors</h2><p>The one-way door mechanic in the Metroid genre can be quite classic. In this game, the E.M.M.I Valve (Monster Exclusive Shortcut) in the E.M.M.I area will be opened for the player after destroying monsters, helping the player to quickly travel through the area. One mechanism, two purposes, convenient for monsters in the early stage, convenient for players in the later stage, is the product of making one-way door design and chase battle deeply integrated.</p>
<h2 id="Growth-Verification"><a href="#Growth-Verification" class="headerlink" title="Growth Verification"></a>Growth Verification</h2><p>It should be noted that the player always grows faster than E.M.M.I, even if E.M.M.I has skills such as Freeze and Electrocute in the later stages. Character enhancements based around mobility allow for exponential growth in dodging and exploration, meaning that later on the player is able to get to everything in sight with little regard for limitations like height and distance.</p>
<p>At this point, the E.M.M.I chase becomes battle after battle of a validating nature - going up against an old friend with improved abilities. The player’s climbing skills and exploding abilities are visually displayed through this chase, allowing for more uses and validation scenarios for those counter-intuitive abilities, while the initial fear gradually dissolves at the end, and a sense of emotional growth is realized.</p>
<h2 id="4-4-Level-specific-shaping-of-experience"><a href="#4-4-Level-specific-shaping-of-experience" class="headerlink" title="4.4 Level-specific shaping of experience"></a>4.4 Level-specific shaping of experience</h2><blockquote>
<p>Earlier we talked about the experience that the mechanics can directly affect:.</p>
<p>Area Mechanics: With the level space in a constantly changing situation, the player can always experience the tension of being constantly chased, the thrill of the chase from running unimpeded, the uncertainty of the paths faced in fast movement and the fulfillment of making a random move without the frustration of having to worry about the high cost of dying.</p>
<p>Counterattack mechanic: Facing fear at the last minute while standing still amplifies the player’s emotions, defeating previously invincible enemies and turning tension into a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Progressive Mechanism: Challenges and rewards follow the player’s growth with appropriate upgrades, ensuring a heart-flow of experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the specific level, the part of the change in addition to follow the progressive mechanism to add new organs, new terrain, monsters, new abilities, basically only in the map structure, route, EMMI birth point and other places to make changes, each level specifically to create a combination of **emergent mechanism **, that is, the route planning is different and need to improvise. Combinations of the above mechanics can often be shaped to create specific experiences such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making most routes unobstructed (i.e., no dead ends) so that the player can always move in one direction, giving the thrill and tension of the chase and the enjoyment of exploring through the map quickly and with less frustration.</li>
<li>Part of the existence of dead-end routes, will definitely give organs to help players bypass the EMMI to go back, such as: along the ceiling using the spider suction cups to go back around, hook lock sliding back to the bifurcated road, enhance the tolerance rate, the player’s trial and error cost is reduced, **able to experience a sustained pulling of the chase battle without feeling the end of the road **.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, by shaping the map’s terrain and placing organs, the level can lead to an ever-changing and varied experience.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="VI-Conclusion-The-Dissolution-of-Fear"><a href="#VI-Conclusion-The-Dissolution-of-Fear" class="headerlink" title="VI. Conclusion: The Dissolution of Fear"></a>VI. Conclusion: The Dissolution of Fear</h1><p>In fact, the chase itself is strongly correlated with two dimensions of Metroid’s core gameplay (maps/abilities). It is both a test of route planning and a validation of ability enhancement. The experience has a good enough atmosphere and detail, and the intention takes fear and uncertainty to provoke players to empathize with exploration. Overall an unexpected and excellent design.</p>
<p>Some have said that Isamu Sakamoto and the team have reinterpreted Metroid, I’d be more inclined to say that they’ve added something new to the core gameplay of maps/abilities that doesn’t feel cutthroat. It’s not like indie games like to do Metroidvania for a day or two, some like to work on their action systems, some rely on their worldviews to get people to buy in, and the vast majority add Castlevania-esque RPG elements (everything can be an RPG). A lot of it falls into being a peripheral set of system designs, more like designing how to pile things on top of a proven playstyle - which certainly makes for better work, and does make for a blossoming and varied Metroidvania. But it’s the only one that can extract new mechanics from the core gameplay and experience like Metroid: Survival Fear.</p>
<p><img src="/img/06.jpg"></p>
<p><strong><center>If you really want to say there’s a “breakthrough” in the genre, you’d have to go back this far to have any hope.</center></strong></p>
